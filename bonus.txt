1. We created an "algorithm" that allows for inline play! In main.cpp, you can change one (or both for a two-player experience) of the algorithms to "UserInputAlgorithm" and compile!
You will be prompted in the terminal for your input, with instructions as well as info on your current direction.

2. We further enhanced the player/viewer experience by printing out the game map for each turn. This is helpful when playing in input mode, and nice to see in two automatic algorithms mode.
